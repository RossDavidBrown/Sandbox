  title: Care Homes Information Service
  description: |-

    *** This is a draft document, this service is not in Production. ***

    The service provides two endpoints.

    One is used to 'confirm' if a citizen's care home residency is of interest to DWP and the other is used to 'notify' DWP of a change in their residency status.

    The /confirm/{consumerGuid} endpoint takes a GET and is used to confirm whether the identified citizen's care home status is of interest to DWP.  The Consumer GUID provided identifies the citizen
    and is obtained by a separate call to the Citizen API / Match service.

    The /notify/{consumerGuid} endpoint takes a POST and is used to notify DWP of a change in a citizen's care home residency for the distinct notification types given below,
    by supplying a corresponding object within the JSON payload (no more than one of each notification type, minimum of one notification) :
    <ul>
      <li> Admission (admission) - initial admission to a care home or re-admission to the same care home.
      <li> Change of circumstances (changeOfCircumstances) - for example, moving to a new care home
      <li> Leaving a care home (leavingCareHome)
      <li> Hospital admission (hospitalAdmission)
      <li> Funding change (fundingChange)
    </ul>

    The Consumer GUID provided identifies the citizen the notification is for.
    <br><br>
    There are certain header fields required in each API call as detailed below -

    | Attribute (M/O) | Type | Description |
    | ---------| ---------- | ---------- |
    | `Authorisation:Bearer (M)` |   String   | The OAUTH2 Access token. |
    | `correlation-id (M)` |   String   | Unique correlation identifier for tracking purpose |
    | `instigating-organisation (M)` |   String   | Validated against DWP's master External Organisation Catalogue |
    | `instigating-system (M)` |   String   | External: Name of sending external system e.g. an external system or application name |
    | `instigating-user-id (M)` |   String   | Identifier of the logged in User ID (used for auditing if auditing is enabled) |
    | `transaction-date (M)` |  DateTime  | Date & time when the communication was instigated |
    | `session-id (O)` |  String  |  |
    | `context (O)` |  String  | This describes the business process that is being enacted and the system enacting it |
    | `Cache-Control (M - confirm)` |  String  | Value : no-store - Ensures Confirm responses are not cached |
